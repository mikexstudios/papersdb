TODOs
=====

- Haystack searching
    - Extract PDF text -> search
- Drag and drop PDF upload
- Change quick link and download link if paper not uploaded.
    - Instead put a link there where, on click, user taken to "edit" page where
      can upload PDF.
- Make paper view page.
- Ability to delete paper.
- Create dummy task for local testing.
- Ability to add supporting information PDF too.

Ideas
=====

- Paper view page
    - I'm thinking like showing paper information at the top of the page. Towards
      the bottom of the page, show embedded google quick view.
    - Two possible ways to edit paper:
        1. Click an edit link -> takes user to edit page.
        2. In-place editing. When user clicks field, turns into text box for editing.
      We should do #1 first since it's less complicated. Also good for the dashboard
      link.
